Time management app based on Pomodoro technique

### Background
The Pomodoro technique was created by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980's. This is a widely used
time management method that utilizes 25 minutes working intervals with 5 minute break intervals.
You can find out more here: [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

The technique implements in this Time Management App utilizes the following steps:
1. Decide on a task to work on.
2. Set timer to work on that task for 25 minutes. 
3. Work.
4. Take a 5 minute break.
5. Repeat steps 2 - 4 four times.
6. Take a longer 15-30 minute break.


### Other Learning Techniques
There have been a lot of interesting findings in the neuroscience field regarding neuroplasticity
and learning protocols. A great way to learn about these findings is through the [Huberman Lab](https://hubermanlab.com/). 
I recommend watching this informative talk by Dr. Andrew Huberman to get a brief overview:
[RETHINK EDUCATION: The Biology of Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo7hQapFe3M)

His Neuroplasticity Protocol can be summarized by:
1. Get alert
2. Get focused
3. Generate repetitions
4. Expect and embrace errors
5. Insert micro-rest intervals (at random)
6. Use random intermittent reward
7. Limit learning sessions to 90 minutes
8. After a learning bout, do a non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) protocol
9. Get quality and suffiently long deep sleep that night (& always)
