# Neuroplasticity Protocol App


## Motivation
There have been a lot of interesting findings in the neuroscience field regarding neuroplasticity
and learning protocols. A great way to learn about these findings is through the [Huberman Lab](https://hubermanlab.com/).
I recommend watching this informative talk by Dr. Andrew Huberman to get a brief overview:
[RETHINK EDUCATION: The Biology of Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo7hQapFe3M)

His Neuroplasticity Protocol can be summarized by:
1. Get alert
2. Get focused
3. Generate repetitions
4. Expect and embrace errors
5. Insert micro-rest intervals (at random)
6. Use random intermittent reward
7. Limit learning sessions to 90 minutes
8. After a learning bout, do a non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) protocol
9. Get quality and suffiently long deep sleep that night (& always)
